My name is AQIL with matrix number, 23001941. I am
majoring in Software Engineering. This is my first time taking the
Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling nervous about taking this
subject. This is because Data Structure is one of the hardest subject .
I acquired C+ for my previous Programming 1 course. Itâ€™s not too bad. So, I
think I can manage to get B or B+ for this DS subject this term. In order
to do well in the subject, I will Practice more . 
I think I have performed well.
My perfomance in programming is getting better.
Data Structure have thought me to think fast to solve problems
I am targeting at least a B+
